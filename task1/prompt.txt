Apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in order to:
 - Analyze a given set of project requirements
 - Justify and select the most suitable type of database for the project
 - give step by step analysis, why you chose the one database instead of others
 - give some comparison (con/pros), read, write speed, etc into a table

The Project description:
You are selecting a database for a new application. 

The requirements:
 - Social platform with millions of users
 - Need to store profiles, posts, and connections between users
 - High data read speed required
 - Expected 80% read operations, 20% write operations
 - Scalability is important as the user base grows
