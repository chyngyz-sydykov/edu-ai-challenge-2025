 high-scale social platform.

üîç Step 1: Analyze Project Requirements
Requirement | Implication
Millions of users | High scalability and performance required
Store profiles, posts, connections | Needs support for structured (profiles, posts) and relational (connections) data
80% reads, 20% writes | Read-optimized system preferred
High data read speed | Fast read queries with minimal latency
Scalability | Must support horizontal scaling (sharding, replication, etc.)

üß† Step 2: Identify Candidate Database Types
    -   Relational Databases (SQL) ‚Äì e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL
    -   Document Databases (NoSQL) ‚Äì e.g., MongoDB
    -   Graph Databases ‚Äì e.g., Neo4j
    -   Wide-Column Stores ‚Äì e.g., Cassandra
    -   Key-Value Stores ‚Äì e.g., Redis (not suitable as a primary DB, more for caching)

üß≠ Step 3: Evaluate Each Option
‚úÖ Option A: Relational DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
    -   Pros: Mature, ACID-compliant, structured data, good support for joins
    -   Cons: Not ideal for horizontal scaling, joins can be slow on massive datasets
    -   Verdict: May work at early stages but difficult to scale for millions of users and highly connected data.

‚úÖ Option B: Document DB (MongoDB)
    -   Pros: Schema-flexible, scalable, fast reads, native replication and sharding
    -   Cons: Joins not efficient (manual aggregation), modeling connections (e.g. mutual friends) is harder
    -   Verdict: Good for posts and profiles, but not ideal for connections/graph-like queries.

‚úÖ Option C: Graph DB (Neo4j)
    -   Pros: Perfect for modeling user connections, fast traversals, optimized for relationships    -   
    -   Cons: Harder to scale horizontally, weaker for bulk document storage
    -   Verdict: Excellent for user connections but not for post/profile data or large-scale write-heavy ops.

‚úÖ Option D: Wide-Column DB (Cassandra)
    -   Pros: Excellent horizontal scalability, high write throughput, tunable consistency, high availability
    -   Cons: No JOINs, hard to model complex relationships
    -   Verdict: Great for feeds and read-heavy use, not good for user relationships or deep querying.

üèÅ Step 4: Final Recommendation ‚Äì Hybrid Approach
üéØ Primary DB: MongoDB (Document Store)
üéØ Secondary DB (for connections): Neo4j (Graph DB)
 - Why MongoDB?
    -   Handles user profiles and posts well (JSON-like docs)
    -   High read speed, horizontal scalability, native support for sharding
    -   Built-in replication suits 80% read workloads

- Why not only Neo4j?

    - Best for relationships but not efficient for storing millions of post documents or serving feeds
    - Hard to scale for massive document data
- Hybrid Strategy Justification:

    - Use MongoDB for storing profiles and posts
    - Use Neo4j for connections (friends, followers, mutuals)
    - Use caching (e.g. Redis) for hot-read optimization

Ease of Use          Mature             | Easy to start     | Complex queries   | Complex to tune

‚úÖ Conclusion
MongoDB is best suited as the primary database for read-heavy, document-based storage (profiles, posts).

Neo4j can be used for connection modeling and relationship queries.

Cassandra could be considered only if massive write throughput is needed (e.g., for logging or feed storage at scale).
